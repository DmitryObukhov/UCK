Welcome to Ubuntu Customization Kit $VERSION!

This tool lets you create Ubuntu live CDs in your language,
with all the necessary language packs preinstalled.
It also changes the boot screen to appear in your chosen language.

Requirements:
1. about 5 GB of free disk space in $HOME/tmp
2. Internet access for fetching language packs

Homepage: http://uck.sourceforge.net
Authors: http://uck.sourceforge.net/team
License: GPL v3
EOF
`

RUN_CUSTOMIZATIONS_TEXT=`cat <<EOF
You will be provided with menu to choose from customization actions when build reaches proper place.

This menu app will be run your Xserver, but with the title "UCK customization menu".
It will appear when unpacking CD and installing predefined packages is done, so it might take a long time.
All operations you do there will affect only customized CD.
You can:
- Run package manager to add or remove software or repositories (see Note 2 for information about upgrading kernel packages).
- Run console app for manual customizations in shell.
- Run predefined customization actions.

When you finish customization, quit the application and building process will proceed.

Note 1: package application will be run after language packs are installed according to previous selections, so you do not have to do this again.

Note 2: upgrading kernel package updates kernel used to run live CD (latest one available will be used). You can remove earlier version using package application, just like any other package.

Note 3: sources.list changes are not propagated to installed system.

Note 4: Simple upgrading system increases CD size, as some other updates might increase size.
You will probably have to remove something from image to make it fit on CD.
EOF
`

PRE_START_TEXT=`cat <<EOF
All the necessary information has been gathered.
Building will now start.

Note: You will have to provide your password on the command-line

Your live CD will be created as:

	$LIVECD_ISO_LOCATION

Please fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride!
EOF
`

BUILD_SUCCESS_TEXT=`cat <<EOF
Building was successful!

You can find your live CD in:

	$LIVECD_ISO_LOCATION

If you have installed the \"qemu\" package, you can test the image by doing:

	qemu -cdrom $LIVECD_ISO_LOCATION -boot d -m 256
EOF
`

BUILD_FAILURE_TEXT=`cat <<EOF
Building failed.

Please look at $REMASTER_HOME/build.log to see what went wrong.

If you cannot find the problem, please send a support request at:
