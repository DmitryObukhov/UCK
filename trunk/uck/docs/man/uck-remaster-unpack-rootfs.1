.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBuck-remaster-unpack-rootfs\fR extracts the root file system stored
in compressed form from an unpacked ISO image (cf. \fBuck-remaster-unpack-iso\fR).
If the argument is not specified, it defaults to ~/tmp.
.PP
By default \fBuck-remaster-unpack-rootfs\fR works by mounting the rootfs image
on a temporary directory and then copying all contents to the directory
\&\fBremaster-root\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fR option is specified, a set of loop back and unionfs mounts
will be used to create a writeable instance of the rootfs image accessible as
\&\fBremaster-root\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR. The modified parts of the root
file system will be cached in \fBremaster-root-cache\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR.
This is a lot faster and requires less disk space, but may not work for all
scenarios and mandates the installation of some additional software (i.e.
fuse-utils and unionfs-fuse).
