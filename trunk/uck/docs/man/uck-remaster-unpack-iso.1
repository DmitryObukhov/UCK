.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBuck-remaster-unpack-iso\fR extracts the ISO image (first argument).
If the second argument is not specified, it defaults to ~/tmp.
.PP
By default \fBuck-remaster-unpack-iso\fR works by mounting the ISO on a
temporary directory and then copying all contents to the directory
\&\fBremaster-iso\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fR option is specified, a set of loop back and unionfs mounts
will be used to create a writeable instance of the ISO image accessible as
\&\fBremaster-iso\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR. The modified parts of the ISO
will be cached in \fBremaster-iso-cache\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR.
This is a lot faster and requires less disk space, but may not work for all
scenarios and mandates the installation of some additional software (i.e.
fuse-utils and unionfs-fuse).
