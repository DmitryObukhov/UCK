.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBuck-remaster-mount\fR mounts the ISO image (first argument) and the
image of the squashed root file system within the ISO image via a series
of loopback and unionfs mounts to create writeable instances of the
images as \fBremaster-iso\fR and \fBreamster-root\fR in \fBremaster-dir\fR.
If the second argument is not specified, it defaults to ~/tmp.
.PP
This may not work for all scenarios and mandates the installation of some
additional software (i.e. fuse-utils and unionfs-fuse).
