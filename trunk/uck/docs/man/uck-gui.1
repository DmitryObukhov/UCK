.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBUbuntu Customization Kit\fR is a tool that helps you customizing
official Ubuntu Live CDs (including Kubuntu/Xubuntu and Edubuntu) to your
needs. You can add (almost) any package to the live system, for example
language packs, or applications.
.PP
If the optional "remaster-dir" is specified this will be used as (local!)
directory that will contain all data created during the customization process.
This defaults to ~/tmp if not specified.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fR option is specified, a set of loop back and unionfs mounts
will be used to create a writeable instance of the ISO image accessible as
\&\fBremaster-iso\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR. The modified parts of the ISO
will be cached in \fBremaster-iso-cache\fR under \fBremaster-dir\fR.
This is a lot faster and requires less disk space, but may not work for all
scenarios and mandates the installation of some additional software (i.e.
fuse-utils and unionfs-fuse).
.PP
The scripts run during customization are a copy of the scripts found in /usr/lib/uck/customization-profiles/localized_cd.
.PP
Note that \fBuck-gui\fR is an interface designed to make localization of and
simple addition of packages to Ubuntu Live-CD's simple, but that the UCK
toolset command line interface is much more powerful.
.PP
There also is an alternative GUI (separately packaged as python_uckflow) that
is somewhat more powerful but requires knowledge of shell programming.
