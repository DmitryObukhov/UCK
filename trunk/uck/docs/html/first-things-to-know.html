<h1>First Things to Know</h1>

<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
UCK (Ubuntu Customization Kit) is a tool used to customize Ubuntu CD's.
<p>
It consists of a set of shell procedures used to perform customization steps
and two graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (also written as shell procedure) that
can be used to perform modifications (i.e. booting, installing and running the
Live System in a language different from English; adding or deleting software
to create a customized CD).
<p>
The wizard GUI is the easiest to use and interactive, but geared towards
one-time customization. For novice users who "Just need to get the language
right and add some stuff" and who only need to do this infrequently this GUI
will guide you through the most common customization tasks.
<p>
The UCK command line interface has few restrictions. The commands provided do
all the "hard stuff" and a seasoned programmer can use them as building blocks
to create a completely customized distribution from almost any media and
version distributed by Canonical or others.
<p>
UCK-FLOW (Ubuntu Customization Kit Workflow Tool) is an alternative graphical
user interface for the Ubuntu Customization Kit. In contrast to UCK GUI, which
is tuned to allow easy execution of common customizations, uck-flow provides a
fine grained control over each of the customization steps. It has templates for
some of the most common customizations, can easily be extended with more
templates and allows (re-)execution of arbitrary customization steps.
<p>
UCK-FLOW with "interactive" or "localized" or "updated" templates can be used
instead of UCK GUI by intermediate users for multiple (re-)customizations.
Advanced uses will require (shell-) programming skills for full customization.

<h2>I've installed UCK, now what?</h2>
You will find UCK-GUI (the easy-to-use graphical user interface) in
<pre>
	Menu / System Tools / Ubuntu Customization Kit
</pre>
or you can launch the UCK gui by typing:<pre>uck-gui</pre> in a terminal.
<p>
The GUI will guide you through the most common customization tasks.</p>

<h2>How do I call the alternative GUI?</h2>
You will find UCK-FLOW (the tool for repeated customizations) in
<pre>
	Menu / System Tools / Ubuntu Customization Kit Workflow Tool
</pre>
or you can lauch uck-flow by typing:<pre>usk-flow</pre> in a terminal.
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
The basic work flow defined by the UCK toolset consists of 13 steps:
<ol>
<li>Get an Ubuntu CD or ISO image. (uck-flow: Prepare ISO File)
<li>(UCK) Extract the contents of an Ubuntu CD or ISO image. (uck-flow: Unpack ISO File)
<li>(UCK) Extract the compressed root file system image. (uck-flow: Unpack Root Filesystem)
<li>Modify the root file system image in a chrooted environment. (uck-flow: Customize Root Filesystem)
<li>Complete root file system image customization outside of chroot. (uck-flow: Finalize Root Filesystem)
<li>(UCK) Re-compress the root file system image. (uck-flow: Pack Root Filesystem)
<li>Modify other parts of the ISO image. (uck-flow: Customize ISO Image)
<li>(Optional) (UCK) Extract the contents of the initial RAM disk. (uck-flow: Unpack INITRD)
<li>(Optional) Modify the initial RAM disk. (uck-flow: Customize INITRD)
<li>(Optional) (UCK) Re-compress the initial RAM disk. (uck-flow: Pack INITRD)
<li>(UCK) Re-assemble the ISO image. (uck-flow: Pack ISO File)
<li>Test/burn CD/... (uck-flow: Test/Deliver)
<li>(UCK) Cleanup. (uck-flow: Cleanup)
</ol>
The steps marked with (UCK) above directly map onto UCK supplied commands, the
steps marked (Optional) above become mandatory if a new version of the Linux
kernel is to be used on the generated ISO or if the initial boot environment
of the Live CD/DVD needs to be customized, all other steps are user definable
actions, posssibly supported by some UCK command.
<h2>What are the prerequisites for running UCK?</h2>
You will need a fairly recent working Ubuntu installation of the same
architecture as the Live CD image you want to customize (cf. the FAQ
on Limitations / Caveats) on either a virtual machine or a workstation with
a sufficently large disk.
<p>
The machine you run UCK on should have a direct connection to the
Internet if you want to update packages or add a language. If you can
only access the Internet via proxies, you (currently) will need to modify
some of the scripts yourself.
<p>
You will need to have root access on the machine you perform the
customizations on.
<p>
Although it may be possible to run UCK on other distributions, this
is not a well supported setup.
<h2>What are known limitations and caveats when using UCK?</h2>
UCK currently requires root privileges for many of the steps. You need to be
able to run sudo (fakeroot will not suffice!) on the machine that you
want to perform customization on. It is generally not a good idea to
run UCK on a server that must be available for production purposes.
It's way better to use a private workstation with no valuable data or
a virtual machine as host.
<P> 
<b>*** You have been warned! ***</b>
<P>
UCK performs customization of the root file system by running commands
(apt-get install et.al.) as root in a chroot environment. This implies that:
<ol>
<li>You generally cannot customize Live CD images for machine
        architectures different from the one you run UCK on, e.g.
        customizing an image for ARM processors will not be possible
        if your machine is x86 based. One exception to this rule is that
        you can customize x86 images on an x86_64 host because 32bit
        binaries can be run on 64bit Linux systems - the reverse (i.e.
        customizing a 64bit system on a 32bit host) is not possible.

    <li>Some commands may not work in the chroot environment, especially
         if they require services that can only be run once on a system.

    <li>While installing/removing packages in the chroot environment,
         services may be stopped/started by the packaging scripts. You will
         need to take care that these services (a) do not collide with
         services running on the customization host and (b) that they
         get terminated near the end of the root file system customization
         because otherwise it may be impossible to successfully finish
         the customization.

     <li>Even though commands run in a chroot environment they run with
          full root privileges. It is therefore possible that the hosting
          system is corrupted by commands going astray, e.g. if the date
          command is run to set the date/time in the chrooted environment
          the date/time of the hosting environment will be affected. Even
          worse: Should a command create a device node that represents a
          device in the hosting system and then decide to format that device
          (or to install a bootloader someplace) the hosting system will
          be unusable afterwards.
</ol>
There are known problems with placing the directories the customization
is done in (usually ~/tmp) on encrypted file systems and it doesn't really
make a lot of sense either - after all you are modifying open source software
that is freely available on the Net ;-)
<p>
Placing the customization directory on a network drive may be possible.
<h2>Before submitting a bug report</h2>
If you have problems with UCK please check for a newer release in our PPA at https://launchpad.net/~uck-team/+archive/uck-stable before submitting a bug report.
<p>
Frequently last minute changes to new Ubuntu releases break UCK and we'd rather spend our time adding features and resolving real issues than to act on bug reports for bugs already fixed.
<p>
When you submit a bug report, please make sure to include the following information:
<ul>
<li>Version of Ubuntu you are running on (output of lsb_release -irs)
<li>Kernel architecture of host system (output of uname -rm)
<li>Version of Ubuntu you are trying to customize
<li>Kernel architecture of the version you are trying to customize
</ul>
When submitting a bug report the build.log file is substantial for us to find bugs quickly. As the build log tends tpo be rather big please do not paste it into the bug report, but add it as an attachment.
<p>
It also does not hurt if you use the extended search to look through bugs that have already been fixed and maybe scan the answer section for the problem you are having ;-)
