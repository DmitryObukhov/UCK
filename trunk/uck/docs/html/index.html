<h1>UCK - Ubuntu Customization Kit</h1>
UCK is a tool that helps you customizing official Ubuntu Live CDs (including
Kubuntu/Xubuntu and Edubuntu) to your needs. You can add (almost) any package
to the live system, for example language packs, or applications.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create bootable LiveCD with predefined languages based on original
    Ubuntu/Kubuntu live CD using a simple wizard GUI
<li>Build live CD with special features using scripts. It is possible to
    customize root filesystem (for example install/remove packages), ISO
    contents (add/remove docs, change names) and initrd (add modules to boot,
    change boot sequence)
<li>Harness the power of the UCK scripts with the uck-flow GUI.
</ul>
<h2>Project details</h2>
UCK is developed and distributed under the GPL v3 license.
<p>
Source code is maintained in SVN at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uck">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/uck</a>.
<p>
As the project is mainly geared towards Ubuntu, packaging, bug tracking and
general support happens on Launchpad <a href="https://launchpad.net/products/uck">
https://launchpad.net/products/uck</a>.
This is also why we only rarely release updated source archives on SourceForge.
<p>
Up-to-date stable packages (src and binary) for recent Ubuntu releases may be
downloaded from
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~uck-team/+archive/uck-stable">
https://launchpad.net/~uck-team/+archive/uck-stable</a>
<p>
Snapshot releases (src and binary) are available from the PPA at
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~uck-team/+archive/uck-unstable">
https://launchpad.net/~uck-team/+archive/uck-unstable</a>.
<p>
There are two mailing lists for UCK on SourceForge, both currently with very
low traffic and only relevant for the UCK development team.
