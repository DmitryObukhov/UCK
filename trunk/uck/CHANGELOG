* Frontend:
	* Fixed usage message in uck-remaster to match the parameter handling
	  that was already implemented.
	* Start message now contains output of uname and lsb_release. This
	  should help to better diagnose problems.
	* customize script now outputs kernel and lsb_release info. This
	  should help to better diagnose problems,
	* uck-gui now gives proper usage message and outputs uname and
	  lsb_release information.
	* uck-gui now passes REMASTER_HOME to uck-remaster. Necessary for
	  changed behaviour of sudo in Natty. Fixes (#748209). Answer
	  questions #151311, #151108, #150223
* Backend:
	* Extract proxy environment variables in uck-gui and pass them on to
	  the chroot environment around sudo calls. Solves (#111253)
	* Modified customize_iso to correctly use REMASTER_HOME if SCRIPT_DIR
	  was not specified.
* Documentation:
	* Fixed uck-gui man page: uck-gui does not accept a customization-dir
	  parameter.

-- 2.4.0 --
-----------

* GUI:
	* GUI now uses kdialog, zenity, dialog or builtin (in that order) if
	  available. (#577197)
	* Updated uck-gui to accept parameters for loopback/unionfs mounting
	  and added the possibility to specify a directory different from ~/tmp
	  for remaster-dir. Change is backward compatible to uck-2.2.0.
	  (Question/Answer 110374)
* Backend:
	* Sequence of actions in uck-remaster changed so that initrd is
	  unpacked/customized/packed after the changes to the root file system
	  and the ISO have been done. This avoids problems when customize_iso
	  installs a new Live-CD kernel and initrd (which would previously be
	  overwritten by the contents of the old initrd, causing a mismatch
	  between the kernel (new) and the initrd (old)).
	* Extended remaster-live-cd.sh by two procedures to perform 
	  loopback+union mounts. (#72727)
	* Added a -m option to uck-gui, uck-remaster, uck-remaster-unpack-iso
	  and uck-remaster-unpack-rootfs that uses a combination of loopback
	  and unionfs mounts instead of copying. This is an experimental
	  feature as of now and not activated by default. It also depends on
	  the packages fuse-utils and unionfs-fuse or aufs-tools, which are not
	  (yet?) pre-requisites for UCK. Documentation for these commands
	  updated accordingly. (#72727)
	  At least unionfs-fuse 0.25~hg.20100315-1 is required (Currently
	  only available from https://launchpad.net/~aakef/+archive/ppa )!
	  Thanks to Bernd Schubert for the superb support in fixing the
	  problems encountered.
	* Added two new commands (uck-remaster-mount and uck-remaster-umount)
	  and documentation. These commands are used to do the loopback/
	  unionfs mounts/umounts required by the -m option described above.
	  (#72727)
	* Added code to library for union_umount to kill processes still using
	  files in the mount. This happens when updates start daemons in the
	  root fs.
	* Updated all manual pages to reference the source / bug reporting URLs.
	* initctl is disabled (replaced with /bin/true) during chroot sessions.
	  With this change is now possible to install mysql/apache and other
	  services in the guest system.
	* update-grub is disabled (replaced with /bin/true) during chroot sessions.
	  With this change is now possible to upgrade kernel in maverick too.
	* host's fstab/mtab are copied to the guest so that chrooted "df" can work.
	* Backend now checks for kpackagekit as packaging tool, too.
	  Note: This requires that packagekit ist installed on the hosting
	  system - otherwise the dbus queries to packagekitd will fail.
	  FIXME: Running packagekitd on the host will give wrong results!!!
	  --> We need to change the strategy here! Upstart has similar issues
	  --> need to start "private" dbus system bus instance?!?
	* Added error checking for arguments to uck-remaster-mount.
	* improved error checking and handling for union mounts: either all or
	  nothing now; imply -m if tell-tale directory (-cache) is found;
	  made reentrant for use by uck-flow; pointless check for
	  uck-remaster-mount removed; fallback to copy if union mount not
	  possible; do not remove target when using mounts.
	* uck-remaster-remove-win32-files now removes usb-creator.exe which
	  was added in maverick
	* Fixed immediate umount in uck-remaster-unpack-{iso,rootfs} by trap
	  EXIT handling when using -m.
	* unmount strategy (after chroot) was rewritten to unmount every mountpoint
	  found inside remaster-root.
* Package:
	* gfxboot-dev dep added for maverick
* Internal:
	* New target updman in Makefile to update manual page version numbers.
	* Updated localbuild.sh procedure to patch the debian/changelog file
	  so that a local unsigned test version can be generated correctly.

* Backend:
	* joliet-long option was added to mkisofs
	* uck-remaster-pack-iso support for live-cd description was added

	  The ISO is still generated in remaster-new-files but will be moved
	  to the new path (thanks to Wolf Geldmacher).
    * uck-remaster-pack-iso md5sum now throws a fatal error
      (thanks to Wolf Geldmacher).
    * uck-remaster-chroot-rootfs arguments (cmd, remaster-home) have been
      swapped (now it is "remaster-home" "cmd"). This aligns the command with
        (a) almost all of the other uck-remaster commands that take remaster-home 
            as first argument
        (b) aligns the command with the chroot built-in shell command
	    (c) allows to pass additional arguments to the command executed in
	        the chroot environment
	  (thanks to Wolf Geldmacher).
    * uck-remaster reflects swap of $1<>$2 for uck-remaster-chroot-rootfs

	  gfxbook locales.
	* the default gfxboot language can be chosen only between the
	  gfxboot available languages (easier selection).
	* default gfxboot language selection was made mandatory

	  were made dynamic
	* If an error happens calling running console application UCK
	  tries to run the fallback xterm

* Backend:
	* No error is thrown if no language packs are going to be installed
	* No language packs are removed from the rootfs if you don't provide
	  at least a language pack to install (otherwise you'll have an ISO
	  with no languages at all)
	* No language selection are removed from gfxboot if you don't choose
	  at least a language pack to install
	* If you don't choose a default boot language UCK does not pass a
	  DEFAULT_LANG variable when rebuilding gfxboot, this won't modify
	  gfxboot default
	* No warning are thrown if "remove_win32_files" file is not present 
	  in the remastering scripts directory
	* a bug with the kernel image selection was solved (now the latest
	  is always selected automatically) (thanks to Dion Stempfley)
	* the way we retrive gfxboot-theme-ubuntu was rewritten using bazaar
	  (the official ubuntu development tool)
	* /var/run was added to the pseudo filesystem that are mounted in
	  the chroot environment

	  before starting the remastering process if a previous
