* Backend:

      (thanks to Wolf Geldmacher).
    * uck-remaster-chroot-rootfs arguments (cmd, remaster-home) have been

        (a) almost all of the other uck-remaster commands that take remaster-home 
            as first argument
        (b) aligns the command with the chroot built-in shell command
	    (c) allows to pass additional arguments to the command executed in
	        the chroot environment
	  (thanks to Wolf Geldmacher).

      was solved (#547260)

	  tries to run the fallback xterm

* Backend:
	* No error is thrown if no language packs are going to be installed

	  at least a language pack to install (otherwise you'll have an ISO
