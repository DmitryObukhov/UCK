uck (2.0.12-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - GUI:
      + splash notes were updated
      + a new configuration screen was added to allow selecting which
        languages will be available on the livecd boot splash (gfxboot).
        This was necessary because the language packs codes do not match
        gfxbook locales.
    - the default gfxboot language can be chosen only between the
      gfxboot available languages (easier selection).
    - default gfxboot language selection was made mandatory
    - Backend:
      + a workaround for the chrooted gnome-terminal was implemented
  * Fixes:
    - LP: #269741
    - LP: #228235
    - LP: #407443
