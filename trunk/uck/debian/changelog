uck (2.0.12-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - GUI:
      + splash notes were updated
      + a new configuration screen was added to allow selecting which
        languages will be available on the livecd boot splash (gfxboot).

        gfxbook locales.

      gfxboot available languages (easier selection).

      + a workaround for the chrooted gnome-terminal was implemented
  * Fixes:
    - LP: #269741
