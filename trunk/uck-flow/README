uck-flow -- the Ubuntu Customization Kit workflow tool
------------------------------------------------------

What it is:
	uck-flow is a workflow oriented GUI for UCK (the Ubuntu Customization
	Toolkit).

	It supports templates and repeatable customization.

	((
	Note: There already is a GUI for UCK named uck-gui. uck-gui is more
	directed to simple/standard customizations and provides a higher
	degree of automation and simplicity for those. uck-flow is more of
	an expert tool - it requires some knowledge of (shell-) programming as
	it exposes more of the customization environment, but also allows much
	greater freedom in what can be customized. It also allows repeated
	customizations starting at (almost) arbitrary points in the
	customization process, provided that the customization procedures are
	re-entrant (i.e. can be run multiple times without adverse effects).
	))

	uck-flow is still in an alpha stage - feedback is welcome!

Prerequisites for Installation:
	You need to have python 2.6 installed with the following modules:
		pygtk
		gtk
		gtk.glade
	(which all happen to be already available in a vanilla Ubuntu setup)
	You also need to have the latest an greatest version of uck
	installed (2.2.0 minimum):
		sudo apt-get install uck

Installation:
	uck-flow comes as a debian package autogenerated from the setup.py
	file in the top-level directory - so a simple
		sudo dpkg -i python-uckflow*.deb
	should suffice.

	If you want to do it the python way (i.e.: python setup.py install)
	feel free to do so. Depending on the configuration of python on your
	system the two commands (i.e. uck-killtree and uck-flow) will end
	up in /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/bin. You will need to (sym-)link
	them to the expected places so that they are found:
		sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/uck-* /usr/bin

Running:
	In a terminal type:
		uck-flow &
	or (if you have already created some project from a template)
		uck-flow project_top_level_directory &

	Have fun!
