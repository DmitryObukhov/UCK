0.4.6
	- Added step so that rootfs customization outside the chroot
	  environment can happen before the root file system is packed again.
	  This allows to copy (demo/package cache) files into the future root
	  file system.
	- Shell handling changed so that all that is required in the target
	  system is /bin/sh. This allows uck-flow to be used to modify/create
	  minimal systems (ubuntu-mini). Also: script can used to append all
	  output of the shell session to the project log by setting the new
	  project variable UCK_SCRIPT_SHELL to "True" in a project. Note that
	  this will usually generate *lots* of somewhat weird output due to
	  the way the script command works.
	- Buffer handling for sys.stdout and sys.stderr nailed to "unbuffered".

0.4.5
	- Added support for -m (mount instead of copy) option.
		- Option handling in uck-flow / uckFlow.py
		- Option storage in uckProject
		- Option evaluation in uckExecutor
	- Added synchronous execution (wait call) to uckExecutor.
	- Fixed lost line in uckProject (function get_new_dir)
	- Modified Makefile to copy generated source archive in preparation
	  for upload to SF.

0.4.4
	- Make sure pack_root is inactive while shell is running. Would
	  otherwise try to pack /proc /sys a.s.o
	- Solve problem with new dialog looping by changing flags of
	  dialog to require an existing directory to be chosen. A new
	  project directory can still be created by using the "Create Dir"
	  button in the dialog.
	- Make preview widgets local to the respective previews.

0.4.3
	- undocumented change of libraray path led to uck-flow breaking - fixed.

0.4.2
	- Added desktop menu entry for uck-flow
	- Shell button now runs a login shell
	- Added a man page
	- Updated README and TODO
	- Added beginning of a library (0.0 version - untested - not delivered)

0.4.1
	- Made version numbering adhere to standards (major.minor.patchlevel)
	- Added dependencies (steb.cfg file) for gtk2 and glade

0.4
	- simple debian package generated from setup.py via "make dist"
	- changed command/pathname from /usr/local/bin/killtree to
	  /usr/bin/uck-killtree (this is where make dist puts it).
	- Added CHANGELOG file that gets redistributed, too.
	- Bumped version number to 0.4
	- Single version now kept in "VERSION" file.
