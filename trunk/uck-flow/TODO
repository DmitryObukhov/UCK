Known Issues:
	- (UCKFLOW) There seems to be a bug in the GTK file dialog that makes
	  uck-flow loop when a new driectory is created when creating a project
	  from a template.
	- (UCK/gksudo/terminal) after chroot we end up in "/" instead of
	  in "/root"
	- (UCK) Environment sourcing in chroot environment (proxies!)
	  (( uck_env=/tmp/customization-scripts/project.uck
	     [ -f "$uck_env" ] && . "$uck_env"
	     in /root/.profile would do the trick for terminal; others are
	     already sourcing project.uck
	     Adding a "cd" would also solve the "/" vs. "/root" issue.))
	- (UCK/gksudo/terminal) group(s) not existing in chrooted environment
	  lead to error message in terminal (groups cmd in /etc/bash.bashrc).
	- (UCKFLOW) "trash" lines in the configuration (e.g. lines like export
	  commands or shell functions) currently work as expected, unless the
	  config file is rewritten (at which point in time they disappear).
	  This is a "useful bug" as it allows normal shell commands to be
	  incorporated in the config but was originally not intended that way.
	  Needs to be properly designed so writing doesn't break it!
	  The budding configuration editor does not support it at all!

Future changes:
	- Remember toplevel window size (how to?)

	- Center uckFlowLog on main window

	- (UCK tools): is /var/run mount really necessary, and if so what for?

	- Proper configuration editor instead of just gedit
		- should dynamically create text fields for configuration
		  items and allow to add items...
		- needs to allow shell syntax for export (proxies) and proxies

	- Refactor templates and create library of script snipplets

	- Proper script composer instead of just gedit:
	  	- Once refactoring templates is done create GUI that allows
		  dropping and parameterizing the refactored script snipplets
		  into the scripts.
	  	- This is a biggy and needs a lot more thought!

	- Eye candy
		- add handling of progress bar / better status messages
