<h1>uck-flow - An alternative GUI for UCK</h1>
uck-flow is an alternative graphical user interface for the Ubuntu
Customization Kit.
<p>
In contrast to uck-gui(1), which is tuned to allow easy execution of common
customizations, uck-flow provides a fine grained control over each of the
customization steps. In order to make use of this flexibility, some (shell-)
programming skills are required.
<p>
uck-flow provides templates for some of the most common customizations,
can easily be extended with more templates and allows (re-)execution of
arbitrary customization steps.
<h2>Quick Start - For the Impatient</h2>
The easiest way to get started with UCK-Flow is to:
<ol>
<li> From the Main Menu select "Project" -&gt; "New from Template"
<li> Select a template from the list (e.g.  "localized") and click "Open"
<li> Select an existing folder / Create a new folder to store the project in.
(select a fresh folder here and merge any existing code into the new
structure afterwards...)
<li> Click "Edit" on the "Click the button to edit the project environment" to
     verify the settings are to your liking.
<li> Click "Edit" on the "prepare ISO" step and look all the way at the end:
You need to copy/link your source ISO image to $UCK_SOURCE.
<li> Toggle the buttons on all the steps you want to perform
<li> Hit the big button that says "Ready..." and enjoy the ride.
</ol>
<p>
You may want to follow what's going on by selecting "View -&gt; Show Log"  and turning on the "Follow Log" checkbox.
<h2>Some UCK Basics</h2>
UCK - the Ubuntu Customization toolKit - is used to customize Ubuntu CD's.
<p>
It consists of a set of shell procedures used to perform customization
steps and a GUI (also written as shell procedure) that can be used to
perform the most frequent modifications (i.e. booting, installing and
running the Live System in a language different from English; adding
or deleting some software to create a customized CD).
<p>
The GUI is aimed at novice users who "Just need to get the language
right and add some stuff" and who only need to do this infrequently.
<p>
The UCK command line interface has no such restrictions, though: The
commands provided do all the "hard stuff" and a seasoned programmer
can use them as building blocks to create a completely customized
distribution from almost any media and version distributed by Canonical
or others.
<p>
The basic work flow defined by the UCK toolset consists of 13 steps:
<ol>
<li>Get an Ubuntu CD or ISO image.
<li>(UCK) Extract the contents of an Ubuntu CD or ISO image.
<li>(UCK) Extract the compressed root file system image.
<li>Modify the root file system image in a chrooted environment.
<li>Modify the root file system image from outside the chroot environment.
<li>(UCK) Re-compress the root file system image.
<li>Modify other parts of the ISO image.
<li>(Optional) (UCK) Extract the contents of the initial RAM disk.
<li>(Optional) Modify the initial RAM disk.
<li>(Optional) (UCK) Re-compress the initial RAM disk.
<li>(UCK) Re-assemble the ISO image.
<li>Test/burn CD/...
<li>(UCK) Cleanup.
</ol>
The steps marked with (UCK) above directly map onto UCK supplied commands,
the steps marked (Optional) above become mandatory if a new version of the
Linux kernel is to be used on the generated ISO or if the initial boot
environment of the Live CD/DVD needs to be customized, all other steps
are user definable actions, posssibly supported by some UCK command.
<h2>Introducing uck-flow</h2>
Uck-flow basically casts the UCK work flow outlined in the previous chapter
into a graphical used interface:
<ul>
<li>All steps outlined in the previous chapter correspond to a row in the
GUI.
<li>Execution of a step can be selected by ticking a checkbox. This will
also activate all subsequent steps that now are required (e.g. ticking
"Unpack INITRD" will also activate "Customize INITRD" and "Pack INITRD").
<li>Activation of a step is only possible if either all prerequisite steps
have been activated for the next run or if uck-flow determines that
they are possible as a result of previous runs. This is especially true
when you open an existing project: If the structure is still available you
can go right ahead with your customization where you left last time.
<li>User definable steps can not only be activated/deactivated like the
others, but also have an "Edit" button associated with them, that allows
to easily edit the procedure implementing the step.
<li>Once the prerequisites are fullfilled a "Shell" button allows to run
a shell within the root file system of the system being customized.
<li>Configuration information required fore all steps of a project is collected
in a single file that can be modified via an "Edit" button, too.
<li>Once you have setup your customization, hitting the "Ready..." button
will execute the steps you selected, either to completion or until the
first error is encountered.
<li>You can watch the progress of your customization by selecting "View
protocol" from the "View" menu and ticking the "Follow" checkbox on the
bottom of the dialog. (This will work only if UCK_LOGFILE variable is set
to a file name in the configuration file. Otherwise, the log is to stdout only.)
<li>You can stop customization by hitting the "Running" button. Depending
on configuration the stop will take effect immediately (default) or after
the currently running step has finished.
</ul>
In addition, uck-flow supplies a few predefined flows (default, interactive,
localized, updated) that can be used as a basis for your own customizations,
cf. the chapter for the impatient at the top of this document.
<ul>
<li>default:
Mostly "no-op" procedures that just comments outlining what you need to fill in for this step. Use this to start a new uck-flow project from scratch.
<li>interactive:
A first shot at mixing some of uck-gui into uck-flow: Semi interactive customization.
<li>localized:
Essentially the localization part of uck-gui, except that you need to define
your language in the project environment file instead of in a dialog.
<li>updated:
Create an updated image (i.e. incorporate all the package changes since the release of the image) of the ISO supplied.
</ul>
You should now go back to the beginning of this text and follow the steps for the impatient to get some "hands-on" experience with uck-flow
<h2>Conclusion and Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because uck-flow is built on the mechanism defined and implemented by UCK,
 it shares its strength and the weaknesses. Most notably:
 <ul>
 <li>The use of a chroot environment to customize the root file system
     restricts UCK (and therefore uck-flow, too) to customizations of images
     whose binaries can be run in the chroot environment.
 <li>As the chroot enivronment shares resources, (e.g. IP addresses and port
     numbers, shared memory, semaphores, ...) with the hosting system not
     all programs and/or services will be installable / runnable.
 </ul>
<li>uck-flow is geared towards multiple (re-)customizations. Therefore the
installation of unionfs-fuse and the use of the -m option uck-flow to make
use of unionfs mounts instead of copying is heartily recommended (although
not required). NOTE: For any given project either -m *must* be given every
time or it *may not* be specified at all. Mixing calls to uck-flow with and
without -m will result in chaos, as the structure required is close but not
identical.
<li>Constructive feedback regarding uck-flow is welcome.
</ul>
