# NAME:
#	customize_root -- customize the root file system
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#	customize_root
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	This script runs as root in the environment of the future root file
#	system (chrooted to the unpacked root file system), therefore some
#	special rules apply:
#
#	- The only data shared between your current system and the future
#	  root file system is the customization-script directory that gets
#	  copied into /tmp of the target root file system (but is *not*
#	  copied back!).
